The idea of this project is to be able to test an extension for Saxon
against a specific or several versions of Saxon, in order to ensure
they are compatible.

Within saxon/, a sub-directory is created by version.  All the *.jar
files are added to the classpath to invoke Saxon.

Within repo/, we maintain several versions of the repository manager
itself (each sub-directory is a different version).  All the *.jar
files are added to the classpath to invoke Saxon.

Within tests/, we add a sub-directory for every module (e.g. HTTP
Client, ZIP, etc.), and within each a sub-directory for every version.
Each test dir (a specific version of a specific module) contains a
stylesheet main.xsl (with a template "main") and a query main.xq to be
run, the result of which is compared against result.xml.  It contains
also a repo called "repo/" which is used to run the test.

Those are just smoke tests to be sure nothing is broken, at the API
level for instance (the Saxon API tends to break compatibility on a
regular basis).

Running a test is then specifying four info: saxon version / repo
version / module / module version.  Several combination can be used to
run several tests at once (e.g. all tests with a specific version of
Saxon, or all tests with a specific version of Saxon and a specific
version of the repository manager).

TODO: Once this first version is operational, link to the XSpec test
suites of the modules instead of using the simple stylesheets and
queries here...
